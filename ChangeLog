	* libctf/ctf_error.c (_ctf_errlist): Synch with the error
	#defines.

	* .gitignore: New, ignore the build directory, editor backup
	files, and object files.

2012-07-16  Nick Alcock  <nick.alcock@oracle.com>

	* Makeconfig (CONFIG_H): Add missing path slash.
	* include/Build (install): Fix silent build output during
	header installation.

	Synch build system from DTrace.

	Add a crude symbol-checking infrastructure, like Autoconf's
	AC_CHECK_LIB.  Use it to check for elf_getshdrstrndx().

	* Makeconfig: New file.
	* GNUmakefile: Include it.  Search the objdir for generated header files.
	* Makefunctions: All C compilations depend on the config.h file.
	* README.build.system: Describe the new infrastructure briefly.

	* GNUmakefile: No longer specify 64-bitness of file I/O: it is
	redundant on x86-64 and breaks fts().

	Creation, split from dtrace and relicensed.
