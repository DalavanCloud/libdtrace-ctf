Unreleased
----------

A new function for iterating over variables stored in a CTF file,
ctf_variable_iter(), is introduced.  Iteration fails immediately if
this is a child CTF file with no associated parent.

0.3.3
-----

A failed ctf_lookup_by_id() of a type which should have been found in a parent
container now sets the errno on the CTF file on which the lookup was initiated,
rather than mistakenly setting it on its parent.

0.3.2
-----

CTF sections are now named .ctf by default, not .dtrace_ctf: this package is
not dependent on DTrace.

0.3
---

First release.
